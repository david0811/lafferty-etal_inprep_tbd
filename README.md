### Output data

All fully processed input data:

_Output data reference goes here._

Note that all output data can be generated by following the instructions in the [How to reproduce the experiment: Sensitivity analysis](#sensitivity-analysis) section.

## Dependencies

- **Python**: include `environment.yml` file
- **R**: include ``sessionInfo()`` output

## How to reproduce the experiment

### Model construction

All relevant scripts/notebooks for this section are found in `workflow/model_construction/code/`

**0) Downloading and pre-processing input data**

To skip these steps, download the processed input data from [*Input data reference*], rename the directory to `input_data` and place in `workflow/model_construction/`

0. Acquire an API key for both USDA NASS (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api) and St. Louis FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). In `00e_usda_data_processing.ipynb` you will need to update the lines `usda_api_key = ...` and `fred_api_key = ...`
1. Run the bash script `00a_gridmet_wget.sh`. This will download all relevant gridMET meteorological data (total size: **~150 GB**)
2. Run the bash script `00b_gmfd_wget.sh`. This will download all relevant GMFD meteorological data (total size: **~50 GB**)
3. Run the bash script `00c_us_shapefiles_wget.sh`. This will download all relevant shapefiles
4. Execute all cells (in order) in `00d_weather_data_processing.ipynb`
5. Execute all cells (in order) in `00e_usda_data_processing.ipynb`. Remember to update the lines `usda_api_key = ...` and `fred_api_key = ...`

**1) Performing the regressions leading to model empirical equations**
